    "## Introduction to Probabilities\n",
    "In 1814, Pierre-Simon Laplace wrote:  \n",
    "> Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation. \n",
    "... [Probability] is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the \n",
    "number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all \n",
    "the cases possible ... when nothing leads us to expect that any one of \n",
    "these cases should occur more than any other.\n",
    "Laplace nailed it. To untangle a probability problem, all you have to do \n",
    "is define exactly what the cases are, and careful count the favorable \n",
    "and total cases. Let's be clear on our vocabulary words:\n",
    "- **Trial**\n",
    "A single occurrence with an outcome that is uncertain until we observe it.  \n",
    "*For example, rolling a single die.*\n",
    "- **Outcome**\n",
    "A possible result of a trial; one particular state of the world. What \n",
    "Laplace calls a **case.** *For example:* `4`.\n",
    "- **Sample Space**\n",
    "The set of all possible outcomes for the trial.   \n",
    "*For example,* `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.\n",
    "- **Event**\n",
    "A subset of the sample space, a set of outcomes that together have some \n",
    "property we are interested in.  \n",
    "*For example, the event \"even die roll\" is the set of outcomes* \n",
    "`{2, 4, 6}`.\n",
    "- **Probability**\n",
    "As Laplace said, the probability of an event with respect to a sample \n",
    "space is the \"number of favorable cases\" (outcomes from the sample space \n",
    "that are in the event) divided by the \"number of all the cases\" in the \n",
    "sample space (assuming \"nothing leads us to expect that any one of these \n",
    "cases should occur more than any other\"). Since this is a proper \n",
    "fraction, probability will always be a number between 0 (representing an \n",
    "impossible event) and 1 (representing a certain event).  \n",
    "*For example, the probability of an even die roll is 3/6 = 1/2.*"
